        <h2 id="story-1-header">Powerbombed in the Pizzeria</h2>
        <p id="pizza-story-text-1">
           I was once in Phil's Pizza on 202 in Branchburg, New Jersey. Highly recommended if anyone
           is wondering. Anyway, my friend who can be a bit loud was giving my other friend a hard time 
           as he normally does. Nothing too mean here, everyone is friends and this is just how we are.
           However, that night we happened to be in the same place as a few professional wrestlers. There was
           an independent promotion going on in the middle school gymnasium. One of the dudes at the wrestlers
           table was the named the Pinnacle. He was huge and had wrestled on tv for a couple of years. The wrestler 
           was a little tired from the show and kindly asked my friend th calm down. However, my friend showed
           him a little attitude and that was it. The wrestler got up, picked up my friend like he weighed nothing,
           and powerbombed him into a table. We waited a couple of weeks before we came back to that place.

        <p id="pizza-story-text-2">
            I was once in Il Forno with my friend and his family. The police busted into the place and 
            arrested the Pizza chef for illegal Pizza smuggling, whatever that is. The big problem was
            that no one was left to make the Pizzas. Luckily, I'm somewhat of Pizza chef myself, and was 
            able to take over for the night. I made Pizzas for our table and everyone else's, and even 
            handled the takeout and delivery orders as well. Luckily, the Pizza chef was released after
            the whole episode was revealed to be a big misunderstanding. It was a memorable night for 
            sure.
