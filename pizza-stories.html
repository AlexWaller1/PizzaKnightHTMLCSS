      <p id="pizza-story-text-1">
        I was once in Phil's Pizza on 202 in Branchburg, New Jersey. Highly
        recommended if anyone is wondering. Anyway, my friend who can be a bit
        loud was giving my other friend a hard time as he normally does. Nothing
        too mean here, everyone is friends and this is just how we are. However,
        that night we happened to be in the same place as a few professional
        wrestlers. There was an independent promotion going on in the middle
        school gymnasium. One of the dudes at the wrestlers table was the named
        the Pinnacle. He was huge and had wrestled on tv for a couple of years.
        The wrestler was a little tired from the show and kindly asked my friend
        th calm down. However, my friend showed him a little attitude and that
        was it. The wrestler got up, picked up my friend like he weighed
        nothing, and powerbombed him into a table. We waited a couple of weeks
        before we came back to that place.

      <h2 id="story-2-header">Sting at the Pizza Joint</h2>
      <p id="pizza-story-text-2">
        I was once in Il Forno with my friend and his family. The police busted
        into the place and arrested the Pizza chef for illegal Pizza smuggling,
        whatever that is. The big problem was that no one was left to make the
        Pizzas. Luckily, I'm somewhat of Pizza chef myself, and was able to take
        over for the night. I made Pizzas for our table and everyone else's, and
        even handled the takeout and delivery orders as well. Luckily, the Pizza
        chef was released after the whole episode was revealed to be a big
        misunderstanding. It was a memorable night for sure.
