           I was once in Phil's Pizza on 202 in Branchburg, New Jersey. Highly recommended if anyone
           is wondering. Anyway, my friend who can be a bit loud was giving my other friend a hard time 
           as he normally does. Nothing too mean here, everyone is friends and this is just how we are.
           However, that night we happened to be in the same place as a few professional wrestlers. There was
           an independent promotion going on in the middle school gymnasium. One of the dudes at the wrestlers
           table was the named the Pinnacle. He was huge and had wrestled on tv for a couple of years.
